# backstock-inventory-manager
This project is aimed to simplify the ownership of a backstock. Here, a backstock is defined as a secondary pantry primarily stocking canned goods and non-perishables for the event of an emergency.

Food still expires, and so stock is rotated out, thus introducing the need for inventory management, which this program aims to resolve.
